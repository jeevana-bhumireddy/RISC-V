Developed a RISC-V single-stage processor capable of executing one instruction per clock cycle.
Implemented core components including instruction memory, decoding, execution, data memory, and register file management with RISC-V compliance.
Evaluated performance metrics like CPI and IPC for efficiency across test scenarios.
