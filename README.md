# ‚öôÔ∏è RISC-V Single-Stage Processor

This project implements a **RISC-V single-stage processor** capable of executing **one instruction per clock cycle**.  
The design follows **RISC-V RV32I architecture** principles and focuses on simplicity, correctness, and efficiency ‚Äî ideal for understanding the fundamentals of processor microarchitecture.

## üß† Overview

The processor executes **fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back** within a single pipeline stage.  
It integrates all major components ‚Äî **instruction memory**, **decoder**, **ALU**, **data memory**, and **register file** ‚Äî into one clock-driven datapath, achieving one-instruction-per-cycle (OIPC) performance for supported instructions.

The project evaluates **CPI (Cycles Per Instruction)** and **IPC (Instructions Per Cycle)** across multiple test programs to verify efficiency and RISC-V compliance.
